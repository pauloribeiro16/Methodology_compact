# Adjusted Objectives per Sub-Domain (Rich Mode)

> **Phase 1 adjusted objectives — tech-free layer.** §1 preserves the corpus-frozen generic baseline; §2-§4 derive the adjusted objectives for the 35 ACTIVE sub-domains along three columns (high-level, GDPR-driven, CRA-driven); §5 resolves the 4 strategic tensions; §6 carries the Track B decision trail.
>
> **Technology-neutral by construction.** §2-§5 name no vendor, product, or tool. Implementation choices live in Appendix A (DEPRECATED, preserved for Phase 2 traceability) and in the Phase 2/Phase 3 deliverables.
>
> **Companion documents:**
> - Doc 07 `07_Structured_Compliance_Matrix.md` §3 — sub-domain coverage matrix (source of the 35 ACTIVE / 3 NOT_ADDRESSED split)
> - Doc 07b `07b_Proportionality_Profile.md` — 5-attribute operationalisation per sub-domain
> - Doc 04 `04_Company_Context_Assessment.md` §4 — Business Goals (BG-01..BG-05) → linked to objectives here
> - Phase 2 legacy `02_PHASE2_RULES/10_Privacy_Security_Goals.md` §3-§4 — superseded per Sprint 4
> - Phase 2 legacy `02_PHASE2_RULES/09_Strategic_Tensions_Report.md` — 4 tensions (T-001..T-004), resolved here with max-SLA routing

## §0 Document Purpose

This document is the **Phase 1 adjusted-objectives layer** of the TinyTask SaaS case. It binds every ACTIVE sub-domain to:

1. A **generic baseline** — HSO + per-regulation Sub-SOs from the corpus (frozen per `proportionality_model.md §1`), in §1.
2. A **high-level adjusted objective** — the corpus HSO restated against the company's actual scope, in §2.
3. A **GDPR-driven adjusted objective** — the corpus GDPR Sub-SO restated against the company's actual scope, in §3.
4. A **CRA-driven adjusted objective** — the corpus CRA Sub-SO restated against the company's actual scope, in §4.
5. A **Track B tier** — inherited verbatim from Doc 07b §4 (MICRO → LIGHTWEIGHT / MINIMAL / DEFERRED), in §6.
6. A **resolution** for each of the 4 strategic tensions (T-001..T-004), in §5.

**Scope of the tables in §2-§4.** 35 sub-domains are ACTIVE. Three sub-domains are NOT_ADDRESSED per Doc 07 §3 (D-02.4 Threat-Led Penetration Testing, D-06.4 Third-Party Boundary Management, D-08.3 Management Board Training) — they carry no regulatory authority for this case and therefore no adjusted objective. They remain in the §6 Track B decision trail where the corpus assigned them a tier, and D-02.4 / D-06.4 retain detail cards in Appendix A.

**Invariant (quoted from `proportionality_model.md §1`):** "The regulatory `fit_criterion` and the HSO are **never modified** by Track B. [...] Track B only varies three axes: `satisfaction_pattern`, `evidence_depth`, `ownership`." This document respects that invariant: the corpus-derived HSOs and Sub-SOs are preserved verbatim in §1; §2-§4 restate them against the company's actual scope without relaxing any regulatory floor, and record every such restatement in an explicit *Adjustment* clause.

**Technology-neutrality criterion.** §2-§5 contain no vendor name, no product name, and no tool or service selection. Regulatory vocabulary that happens to name an artefact (software bill of materials, coordinated vulnerability disclosure, EU declaration of conformity) is retained because it is the text of the obligation, not an implementation choice.

---

## §1 Generic Baseline (preserved from corpus)

> HSO + Sub-SOs from `00_METHODOLOGY/PREPROCESSING_by_domain/domains/D-XX.Y/`. NOT modified by Track B per `proportionality_model.md §1`. This is the **frozen regulatory baseline** — the floor that the Adjusted Objectives in §2/§3/§4 must reach or exceed.

> **AO ID model (corr-008).** §3 and §4 below carry corpus SO-D-XX.Y.GDPR / SO-D-XX.Y.CRA references and inline `formerly_known_as` aliases (`formerly PG-D-XX.X-NNN` / `formerly SG-D-XX.X-NNN`) where the legacy corr-007 PG/SG IDs are referenced for traceability. Appendix A preserves the 74 detail cards with their original PG/SG headings for the Phase 2 � Phase 1 traceability link; the alias table at the top of Appendix A maps every PG/SG ID to its AO equivalent.

## §2 High-Level Adjusted Objectives per Sub-Domain

> The corpus **high-level SecurityObjective** (`SO-D-XX.Y.HL`) for each ACTIVE sub-domain, restated against the company's actual scope: an EU-domiciled, 8-person, MICRO-scale B2B SaaS that is simultaneously a data controller and a manufacturer of a product with digital elements. Where the corpus HSO spans regulators or capabilities that are out of scope for this case, the reduction is stated explicitly in an *Adjustment* clause and never lowers an in-scope floor.

**35 rows — one per ACTIVE sub-domain.** Tier from Doc 07b §4 / §6 below; priority from Doc 07 §3. AO IDs use the convention `AG-D-XX.X-001` for the HL regulation-agnostic objective (one per sub-domain); the regulation-driven §3 GDPR row and §4 CRA row carry slot 001 / slot 002 respectively for downstream traceability.

| Sub-Domain | AO ID | Adjusted Objective (statement) | Tier | Priority | Source |
|------------|-------|--------------------------------|------|----------|--------|
| **D-01.1** Data at Rest Encryption | `AG-D-01.1-001` | Data held at rest in the company's storage is protected against unauthorised access through appropriate technical measures — primarily encryption with appropriate key custody — calibrated to the risks identified in the company's risk assessment and commensurate with the state of the art.<br>*Adjustment (TinyTask): At MICRO scale the encryption capability and its key custody are inherited from the managed hosting layer rather than operated in-house.* | LIGHTWEIGHT | MUST | `SO-D-01.1.HL` · Art. 5(1)(f) + Art. 32(1)(b) ∧ Annex I Part I (2)(e) · `D-01_Data-Protection/D-01.1` |
| **D-01.2** Data in Transit Encryption | `AG-D-01.2-001` | Data in transit — across network paths, inter-service calls, and third-party interfaces — is protected against unauthorised disclosure and alteration through cryptographic confidentiality and integrity controls, including mutual authentication, encryption, and integrity verification. | LIGHTWEIGHT | MUST | `SO-D-01.2.HL` · Art. 32(1)(b) + Art. 32(2) ∧ Annex I Part I (2)(e) + (2)(j) · `D-01_Data-Protection/D-01.2` |
| **D-01.3** Key Management | `AG-D-01.3-001` | Cryptographic keys and related authentication material are managed with separation of roles, so that possession of the key material is not bundled with possession of the operational environment that uses it. The key — not the storage medium — is the necessary condition for intelligibility of the protected data.<br>*Adjustment (TinyTask): With an 8-person team, custodian and consumer roles cannot be staffed by disjoint individuals; separation is achieved at the platform-role level and documented as such.* | LIGHTWEIGHT | MUST | `SO-D-01.3.HL` · Art. 4(5) + Art. 32(1)(a) ∧ Annex I Part I (2)(d) + (2)(e) · `D-01_Data-Protection/D-01.3` |
| **D-01.4** Data Integrity | `AG-D-01.4-001` | Data integrity is preserved against unauthorised modification across the data lifecycle — at rest, in transit, and in use — with corruption detected, logged, and reported, and with semantic accuracy maintained as the workflow leg of the personal-data principle. | LIGHTWEIGHT | MUST | `SO-D-01.4.HL` · Art. 5(1)(d) + Art. 5(1)(f) + Art. 16 ∧ Annex I Part I (2)(f) + (2)(l) · `D-01_Data-Protection/D-01.4` |
| **D-02.1** Vulnerability Identification | `AG-D-02.1-001` | Vulnerabilities are identified on a continuing basis across the product and the systems the company operates, with the resulting identification artefact — vulnerability register or component inventory — feeding the company's testing, remediation, and notification cascades.<br>*Adjustment (TinyTask): The AI-system attack-surface leg of the corpus HSO does not activate: the product embeds no AI system.* | LIGHTWEIGHT | MUST | `SO-D-02.1.HL` · Art. 32(1)(d) + Art. 35(11) ∧ Annex I Part I (2)(a) + Annex I Part II (1) · `D-02_Vulnerability-Management/D-02.1` |
| **D-02.2** Patch Management | `AG-D-02.2-001` | Vulnerabilities identified in the upstream identification pipeline are addressed and remediated through security updates distributed via a secure, separated channel, under a company policy governing severity-classified deployment windows. | LIGHTWEIGHT | MUST | `SO-D-02.2.HL` · Annex I Part II (2) + (7) + (8) + Art. 13(8) + Art. 13(9) · `D-02_Vulnerability-Management/D-02.2` |
| **D-02.3** Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure | `AG-D-02.3-001` | A coordinated vulnerability disclosure ecosystem is maintained, covering the company's disclosure policy — intake, triage, publication, post-disclosure verification — and a publicly identifiable contact address for vulnerability reporting.<br>*Adjustment (TinyTask): The institutional CSIRT-coordinated pathway in the corpus HSO does not activate: the company is not an essential entity under the network-and-information-systems regime.* | LIGHTWEIGHT | MUST | `SO-D-02.3.HL` · Annex I Part II (4) + (5) + (6) + Art. 13(17) · `D-02_Vulnerability-Management/D-02.3` |
| **D-03.1** Identity Lifecycle | `AG-D-03.1-001` | Identities of principals that interact with the company's systems, product, services and data are managed in a verifiable, lifecycle-aware manner, with documented boundaries between identity types and explicit hand-off protocols at boundary surfaces. | MINIMAL | MUST | `SO-D-03.1.HL` · Art. 12(6) + Art. 11(2) ∧ Annex I Part I (2)(d) + Art. 13(15) · `D-03_Access-Control/D-03.1` |
| **D-03.2** Authentication Strength | `AG-D-03.2-001` | Authentication of users, services, and hardware interacting with the company's systems and product operates through a mechanism of sufficient strength for the risk in scope, with the strictest applicable floor discharging the more permissive one on the same authentication event. | MINIMAL | MUST | `SO-D-03.2.HL` · Art. 28(3)(b) + Art. 29 + Art. 12(6) ∧ Annex I Part I (2)(d) · `D-03_Access-Control/D-03.2` |
| **D-03.3** Authorisation & Least Privilege | `AG-D-03.3-001` | The entitlement to perform actions on the company's systems, product, services and data is managed per least privilege, with an explicit authorisation-model choice, documented entitlements, attack-surface-limitation evidence, and boundary hand-offs between access surfaces. | LIGHTWEIGHT | MUST | `SO-D-03.3.HL` · Art. 29 + Art. 32(4) + Art. 28(3)(a)/(b) ∧ Annex I Part I (2)(d) + (2)(j) · `D-03_Access-Control/D-03.3` |
| **D-03.4** Secure System Defaults | `AG-D-03.4-001` | The default disposition of the company's processing systems and of the product's configuration is the minimum-necessary, secure baseline state, with relaxation requiring affirmative data-subject or user intervention. | LIGHTWEIGHT | MUST | `SO-D-03.4.HL` · Art. 25(1) + Art. 25(2) ∧ Annex I Part I (2)(b) + (2)(c) · `D-03_Access-Control/D-03.4` |
| **D-04.1** Incident Detection & Triage | `AG-D-04.1-001` | Security-relevant events affecting the company's systems, product, services and data are detected and triaged with documented trigger moments that anchor the downstream notification and response pipelines. | LIGHTWEIGHT | MUST | `SO-D-04.1.HL` · Art. 33(1) + Art. 4(12) ∧ Annex I Part I (2)(l) · `D-04_Incident-Response/D-04.1` |
| **D-04.2** Containment & Mitigation | `AG-D-04.2-001` | Security incidents affecting the company's systems, product, services and data are contained and mitigated through appropriate measures that address the incident's impact and reduce the probability of further damage. | LIGHTWEIGHT | MUST | `SO-D-04.2.HL` · Art. 34(3)(a)/(b) + Art. 33(3)(d) ∧ Annex I Part I (2)(h) + (2)(i) + (2)(k) · `D-04_Incident-Response/D-04.2` |
| **D-04.3** Regulatory Notification | `AG-D-04.3-001` | A major security incident is notified to the applicable recipients within the regulatory timelines applicable to the event's material scope.<br>*Adjustment (TinyTask): Both regimes bind the same 8-person team on the same artefact; see T-001 in §5 for the max-SLA routing that resolves the divergent deadlines.* | LIGHTWEIGHT | MUST | `SO-D-04.3.HL` · Art. 33(1) ∧ Art. 14(2)(a)–(c) · `D-04_Incident-Response/D-04.3` |

## §3 GDPR-Driven Adjusted Objectives per Sub-Domain

> The corpus **GDPR Sub-SO** (`SO-D-XX.Y.GDPR`) for each ACTIVE sub-domain, restated against the company's actual scope. Seven sub-domains carry no GDPR Sub-SO in the corpus and are marked N/A: D-02.2, D-02.3, D-06.2, D-07.2, D-07.3, D-07.4, D-09.3. Article citations and NIST CSF anchors are reproduced from the corpus.

**35 rows — 28 populated + 7 N/A.** AO IDs use `AG-D-XX.X-001` (GDPR-driven slot). N/A rows carry `—`; their slot-001 mapping is preserved in Appendix A.A.0 alias table under note "corpus CRA-only" / "no GDPR Sub-SO".

**Inline notes — critical IDs carried in the main flow:**

- **`AG-D-01.3-001` (D-01.3 Key Management, formerly `PG-D-01.3-001`)** — Phantom goal. `CR-D-01.3-001` in the Phase 2 catalog references the legacy PG ID, but `OBL-D-01.3-001` carries no PG/SG in Phase 2 Doc 10; the goal exists only in this document's Appendix A. Carried as finding **F-01 / F-03** (LOW); resolution deferred to the human arbiter per AGENTS.md P7. The regulatory obligation itself is unaffected and is stated in the D-01.3 row above.
- **`AG-D-09.1-001` (D-09.1 Information Security Policies, formerly `PG-D-09.1-001`)** — Dual-coverage with `AG-D-09.1-002` (formerly `SG-D-09.1-001`; finding F-02, documented as intentional; NI reconciled to 2.500 under F-10). The same policy architecture satisfies both GDPR Art. 24 and CRA Art. 31 — one artefact, two regulatory readings.
- **`AG-D-09.2-001` (D-09.2 Impact & Risk Assessments, formerly `PG-D-09.2-001`)** — Dual-coverage with `AG-D-09.2-002` (formerly `SG-D-09.2-001`). Resolved by tension **T-M-001**: a single unified assessment produces both the data-protection impact assessment and the product cybersecurity risk assessment as dual outputs.

## §4 CRA-Driven Adjusted Objectives per Sub-Domain

> The corpus **CRA Sub-SO** (`SO-D-XX.Y.CRA`) for each ACTIVE sub-domain, restated against the company's actual scope. One sub-domain carries no CRA Sub-SO in the corpus and is marked N/A: D-05.4 (Data Portability is a data-protection-only right). Article citations and NIST CSF anchors are reproduced from the corpus.

**35 rows — 34 populated + 1 N/A.** AO IDs use `AG-D-XX.X-002` (CRA-driven slot). The single N/A row carries `—`; its slot-002 mapping is preserved in Appendix A.A.0 alias table under note "corpus GDPR-only".

| Sub-Domain | AO ID | Adjusted Objective (statement) | Tier | Priority | Source |
|------------|-------|--------------------------------|------|----------|--------|
| **D-01.1** Data at Rest Encryption | `AG-D-01.1-002` | Where the product stores data — personal or other — the confidentiality of that data is protected by encrypting relevant data at rest using state-of-the-art mechanisms.<br>*Adjustment (TinyTask): The state-of-the-art anchor is the stricter of the two floors on this subdomain; meeting it discharges the data-protection `appropriate` obligation on the same datastore.* | LIGHTWEIGHT | MUST | `SO-D-01.1.CRA` · Annex I Part I (2)(e) · NIST CSF PR.DS-01 · `D-01_Data-Protection/D-01.1` |
| **D-01.2** Data in Transit Encryption | `AG-D-01.2-002` | Where data is transmitted by the product — personal or other — the confidentiality of the data in transit is protected by encrypting relevant data using state-of-the-art mechanisms, with the attack-surface-limitation leg constraining the exposed interfaces through which the data could otherwise leak. | LIGHTWEIGHT | MUST | `SO-D-01.2.CRA` · Annex I Part I (2)(e) + (2)(j) · NIST CSF PR.DS-02, PR.IR-01 · `D-01_Data-Protection/D-01.2` |
| **D-01.3** Key Management | `AG-D-01.3-002` | Cryptographic keys and related authentication material used to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data stored, transmitted or otherwise processed by the product are managed with separation of roles, so that possession of the key material is not bundled with possession of the operational environment that uses it.<br>*Adjustment (TinyTask): The Annex I text does not mention key management explicitly; the key-separation reading rests on combining the access-control duty with the `other technical means` residual, flagged as a text-versus-interpretation gap in the corpus synthesis catalogue.* | LIGHTWEIGHT | MUST | `SO-D-01.3.CRA` · Annex I Part I (2)(d) + (2)(e) · NIST CSF PR.DS-01, PR.AA-05, GV.OV-01 · `D-01_Data-Protection/D-01.3` |
| **D-01.4** Data Integrity | `AG-D-01.4-002` | The integrity of stored, transmitted, or otherwise processed data — as well as the integrity of commands, programs, and configuration — is protected against any manipulation or modification not authorised by the user, and corruption is reported to the user or administering party.<br>*Adjustment (TinyTask): The universal quantifier `any` makes this integrity protection unconditional — it admits no risk-based relaxation at MICRO scale.* | LIGHTWEIGHT | MUST | `SO-D-01.4.CRA` · Annex I Part I (2)(f) + (2)(l) · NIST CSF PR.DS-01, PR.DS-10, PR.PS-04 · `D-01_Data-Protection/D-01.4` |

**Inline notes — critical IDs carried in the main flow:**

- **`AG-D-04.3-002` (D-04.3 Regulatory Notification, formerly `SG-D-04.3-001`)** — Anchor goal for tension **T-001**. Highest-priority SG in the case and the only HIGH-risk profile: the internal notification workflow runs on the **max-SLA 24h** routing so that the shorter of the two regulatory deadlines governs the single internal clock. See §5 T-001.
- **`AG-D-09.1-002` (D-09.1 Information Security Policies, formerly `SG-D-09.1-001`)** — Dual-coverage with `AG-D-09.1-001` (formerly `PG-D-09.1-001`); the same policy architecture discharges both. Technical documentation retention is **10 years or the support period, whichever is longer** (CRA Art. 13(13)). Normalised Intensity **2.500** is authoritative per the Sprint 4 reconciliation of finding F-10 (superseding the legacy 2.750).
- **`AG-D-09.2-002` (D-09.2 Impact & Risk Assessments, formerly `SG-D-09.2-001`)** — Dual-coverage with `AG-D-09.2-001` (formerly `PG-D-09.2-001`); the same assessment framework serves both, per T-M-001.

## §5 Tensions Resolved (4 tensions)

> Per Doc 05 §7 Strategic Implications + `phase1_ontology.yaml` tensions + Phase 2 `09_Strategic_Tensions_Report.md` legacy. IDs T-001..T-004 preserved. Resolutions are stated as workflow and documentation dispositions; no vendor, product, or tool is named. The tech-rich resolution detail from v2.0 is preserved in Appendix A's detail cards.

### T-001 (D-04.3) — Notification timing difference

**Type:** timing | **Severity:** HIGH

**Root cause.** Two regulations impose different notification deadlines on the same event — one 72 hours, the other 24 hours — and the company occupies both regulated roles simultaneously. A single incident therefore triggers both obligations, with clocks that start from related but distinct awareness moments and recipients that are different bodies.

**Resolution.** A single internal notification workflow operates with the **shortest applicable regulatory deadline**. A unified event record generates per-recipient submissions from one clock-start discipline, so the company bears both obligations on the same artefact rather than running two parallel workflows with divergent service levels.

**Risk if unresolved.** HIGH — fines up to €10M or 2% of turnover under the longer-deadline regulation, plus market-surveillance non-conformity under the shorter. For an 8-person team the cumulative exposure could be existential.

**Anchors:** §2/§3/§4 D-04.3 rows; `AG-D-04.3-002` (Appendix A; formerly `SG-D-04.3-001`).

### T-002 (D-06.1, D-06.3) — Vendor-management scope

**Type:** scope | **Severity:** MEDIUM

**Root cause.** One regulation governs downstream data processors; the other governs the entire product supply chain including open-source dependencies. The two scopes overlap on the same suppliers but ask different questions of them.

**Resolution.** A **single vendor-management template** addresses both the data-processor obligations and the product supply-chain obligations, producing dual-output documentation that satisfies both regulatory scopes from one due-diligence pass.

**Risk if unresolved.** MEDIUM — processor non-compliance plus a supply-chain gap. Mitigation cost is bounded by the reuse: the marginal effort of the second scope is small once the first is documented.

**Anchors:** §2/§3/§4 D-06.1 and D-06.3 rows; `AG-D-06.1-001`, `AG-D-06.1-002`, `AG-D-06.3-001`, `AG-D-06.3-002` (Appendix A; formerly `PG-D-06.1-001`, `SG-D-06.1-001`, `PG-D-06.3-001`, `SG-D-06.3-001`).

### T-003 (D-09.4, D-09.1) — Documentation overlap

**Type:** requirement | **Severity:** MEDIUM

**Root cause.** Two regulations require written records with materially different content focus and structure — one oriented to processing activities, the other to product technical documentation — yet both describe the same underlying system.

**Resolution.** A **unified documentation repository** serves both the records-of-processing requirement and the technical-documentation requirement, with retention aligned to the **longest applicable regulatory floor** (10 years or the support period, whichever is longer).

**Risk if unresolved.** MEDIUM — audit findings under both regulations. Mitigation is procedural (template unification), not infrastructural, so it does not compete for engineering capacity.

**Anchors:** §2/§3/§4 D-09.1 and D-09.4 rows; `AG-D-09.1-001`, `AG-D-09.1-002`, `AG-D-09.4-001`, `AG-D-09.4-002` (Appendix A; formerly `PG-D-09.1-001`, `SG-D-09.1-001`, `PG-D-09.4-001`, `SG-D-09.4-001`).

### T-004 (D-08.2) — Data-protection versus product-security competence

**Type:** intensity | **Severity:** LOW

**Root cause.** An 8-person team must carry both data-protection competence and product-security competence. At MICRO scale these overlap in the same individuals; at LARGE or MAX scale they are distinct roles with distinct reporting lines.

**Resolution.** A **competency matrix** covers both data-protection and product-security competence, with separation of duties preserved at the role-documentation level even where the same person holds both roles.

**Risk if unresolved.** LOW — the competent-personnel requirement is procedural. Documenting competence discharges the obligation; no headcount change is implied at current scale.

**Anchors:** §2/§3/§4 D-08.2 row; `AG-D-08.2-001`, `AG-D-08.2-002` (Appendix A; formerly `PG-D-08.2-001`, `SG-D-08.2-001`).

## §7 NIST Controls Mapping

> **Full coverage scope.** This section maps all 35 ACTIVE sub-domains to NIST CSF 2.0, NIST PF 1.0, and (where applicable) NIST AI RMF controls. Per control, the full content lives at `00_METHODOLOGY/PREPROCESSING_by_domain/CONTROLS/<framework>/<function>/<control_id>.json`. The by-subdomain aggregated mapping (separated by framework) lives at `00_METHODOLOGY/PREPROCESSING_by_domain/CONTROLS/by_subdomain/<D-XX.X>.json`.

> **Three NOT_ADDRESSED sub-domains (D-02.4, D-06.4, D-08.3)** are excluded per Doc 07 §3 — they have no regulatory authority for this case and therefore no §7 entry. They remain in §6 Track B decision trail where the corpus assigned them a tier.

### §7.36 Provenance

- **Source files:** `00_METHODOLOGY/PREPROCESSING_by_domain/Things/*.xlsx` (NIST CSF 2.0 Implementation Examples, NIST PF 1.0 Core, NIST AI RMF Playbook) + `00_METHODOLOGY/PREPROCESSING_by_domain/_global/*.md` (NIST CSF 2.0 subcategories reference) + sub-domain corpora at `00_METHODOLOGY/PREPROCESSING_by_domain/domains/D-XX_*/D-XX.X/D-XX.X.json`
- **Mapping date:** 2026-08-14
- **Coverage scope:** 35 ACTIVE sub-domains (D-01.1..D-10.3 minus D-02.4, D-06.4, D-08.3 NOT_ADDRESSED). 3 NOT_ADDRESSED sub-domains excluded per Doc 07 §3.
- **Controls total:** ~300 NIST CSF 2.0 + ~200 NIST PF 1.0 across 35 sub-domains (see §7 cross-references).
- **Pilot date (D-01.1 only):** 2026-08-13 — full coverage achieved 2026-08-14.

## §8 Cross-References

- **Appendix A**: All 74 detail cards (previously §2a/§3a, originally PG/SG, now alias-mapped to AO IDs per corr-008) preserved here for traceability with Phase 2 — `11_Rules_Catalog.md` and `12_Rules_Catalog.xlsx` reference these IDs in their "Related Goals" column. The alias table at the top of Appendix A maps every legacy PG/SG ID to its corr-008 AO equivalent.
- **Doc 04 §4 BG-01..BG-05**: Business Goals → Adjusted Objectives traceability. Each BG cell carries the AO ID directly plus the §2 / §3 / §4 column reference (corr-015 update): BG-01 → §1 + §2 + §3; BG-02 → §2 + §4; BG-03 → §3 D-05.3 (`AG-D-05.3-001`) + D-05.4 (`AG-D-05.4-001`); BG-04 → §3 D-02.1 (`AG-D-02.1-001`) + §4 D-02.1 (`AG-D-02.1-002`) + D-07.x; BG-05 → §3 D-06.1 (`AG-D-06.1-001`) + §4 D-06.1 (`AG-D-06.1-002`) + §5 T-002. Both AO IDs and Appendix A.A.0 alias are listed.
- **Doc 07 Sub-Domain Coverage Matrix (§3)**: Source of the 35 ACTIVE / 3 NOT_ADDRESSED split used in §2-§4.
- **Doc 07b Proportionality Profile**: 5-attribute per-sub-domain operationalisation (`satisfaction_pattern`, `evidence_depth`, `verification_method`, `ownership`, `example_controls`).
- **Doc 05b Ambiguity Register**: 417 ambiguity cards (R1/R2/R3 variant readings) — informs disambiguation of the generic objectives in §1.
- **Phase 2 `10_Privacy_Security_Goals.md` (legacy)**: Original PG/SG formulation. Sprint 4 elevated PG/SG to Phase 1 Rich; legacy remains as Phase 2 reference but superseded (corr-008 now replaces PG/SG with PO/SO).
- **Phase 2 `09_Strategic_Tensions_Report.md` (legacy)**: Original tensions list (T-001..T-004) — same IDs preserved here, now resolved with max-SLA routing in §5.
- **`00_METHODOLOGY/REFERENCE/proportionality_model.md` §1, §5, §6**: Invariant + decision table + tier attribute definitions (cited throughout).
- **`00_METHODOLOGY/PREPROCESSING_by_domain/domains/D-XX.Y/`**: Corpus source for the HSO + Sub-SOs in §1 and for the restated objectives in §2-§4.

---

## §9 Validation

- **35 ACTIVE sub-domains × 3 columns** (high-level + GDPR-driven + CRA-driven) = **105 cells** in §2-§4, of which **8 are N/A** (7 GDPR: D-02.2, D-02.3, D-06.2, D-07.2, D-07.3, D-07.4, D-09.3; 1 CRA: D-05.4) → **97 populated adjusted objectives**.
- **AO IDs in §2/§3/§4 (corr-015 / v5.0)**: 35 entries in §2 (slot 001) + 28 in §3 (slot 001) + 34 in §4 (slot 002) = **97 AO entries**, with **8 carrying `—` for N/A cells** (7 GDPR + 1 CRA). Distinct AO IDs used in main tables: **35 slot 001 (HL/GDPR-driven, one per ACTIVE sub) + 34 slot 002 (CRA-driven) = 69 distinct IDs**.
- **74 AO IDs preserved in Appendix A** (corr-008 migration: 37 PG-derived → 37 AG-D-XX.X-001 + 37 SG-derived → 37 AG-D-XX.X-002). All 47 PG/SG legacy IDs referenced by Phase 2 deliverables resolve within this file via the Appendix A.A.0 alias table (74 rows × 5 columns: legacy → AO → regulation → sub-domain → notes).
- **§A.0 alias table enrichment (corr-015)**: 2 new columns (`Regulation`, `Sub-domain`) added in v5.0 — Phase 2 callers can now resolve a legacy PG/SG ID to its regulation and sub-domain without cross-referencing §2-§4.
- **6 critical IDs documented in the main flow** with inline notes (now AO IDs with `formerly` aliases): `AG-D-01.3-001` (formerly `PG-D-01.3-001`), `AG-D-04.3-002` (formerly `SG-D-04.3-001`), `AG-D-09.1-001`/`AG-D-09.1-002`, `AG-D-09.2-001`/`AG-D-09.2-002` (§3 and §4).
- **§2 / §3 / §4 / §5 are technology-free** — no vendor, product, or tool named (verified by blocklist scan and by inspection).
- **§1 is preserved verbatim** and contains 2 corpus-frozen quasi-technical terms (`CI/CD` in the D-07.3 HSO, `SBOM` in the D-06.2 HSO), retained per the `proportionality_model.md §1` invariant.
- **Track B decision table: 37 rows** in §6 (35 ACTIVE + D-02.4 + D-06.4). D-08.3 is NOT_ADDRESSED and was never tiered.
- **Distribution (37 tiered rows): 31 LIGHTWEIGHT + 5 MINIMAL + 1 DEFERRED = 37** (matches Doc 07b §3 + §4 verbatim). Restricted to the 35 ACTIVE rows of §2-§4: **31 LIGHTWEIGHT + 4 MINIMAL**, all MUST.
- **4 tensions resolved** with max-SLA routing in §5 (T-001..T-004, IDs preserved from legacy Phase 2 + `phase1_ontology.yaml`).
- Floor rule preserved: every MUST ≥ MINIMAL per `proportionality_model.md §5.3`.
- Lints: see `validation/SPRINT4_REPORT.md` — RICH folder is lint-safe per lints scope (legacy `01_PHASE1_CONTEXT/` + `00_COMMON/` only). **v4.0 (corr-009)**: Phase 2 lints `lint_10_pso_rules` and `lint_11_rules_catalog` accept legacy PG/SG/CR/BPR IDs with DEPRECATED warnings during the transition window; new PO/SO/RULE patterns are accepted as PASS.
- **v5.0 (corr-015)**: `validate_aegis_ids.py --quiet` passes — all 74 distinct AO IDs in this file cross-reference validly. Phase 1/2/3 lint gates remain PASS (Document Structure fails pre-existing pattern on §0/§10 vs "1./2." numbered headings; not introduced by corr-016).

| 2.0 | 2026-08-06 | Sprint 5 Executor | Deep enrichment — 74 detail cards (12 fields each: Description, Scope, Out of scope, Source Article, Corpus path, NIST CSF Anchors, Verification Criteria, Verification Method, Owner, Status, Dependencies, Risk, Affected Stakeholders, Maturity Score, Implementation Priority). 4 tensions expanded to multi-paragraph root cause analysis + source citations + resolution options + implementation + verification. **NO Effort/Cost/Timeline fields added** per Sprint 5 scope. Tables enriched with "See full details" anchor column. **Superseded by v3.0** — the tech-rich §2/§2a/§3/§3a of this version are preserved verbatim in Appendix A. |
| 3.0 | 2026-08-10 | Executor (Sprint 7) | Phase 1 tech-free restructure. New §2/§3/§4 (high-level + GDPR-driven + CRA-driven, 35 rows × 3 columns, hybrid format) derived from the regulatory corpus. 4 tensions rewritten without technology references (§5). 74 PG/SG detail cards preserved in Appendix A (DEPRECATED). 6 critical IDs (`PG-D-01.3-001`, `SG-D-04.3-001`, `PG`/`SG-D-09.1-001`, `PG`/`SG-D-09.2-001`) retained in the main flow with inline notes. Scope corrected to 35 ACTIVE sub-domains per Doc 07 §3 (D-02.4 / D-06.4 / D-08.3 NOT_ADDRESSED). |
| 4.0 | 2026-08-10 | Sprint 8 Executor (corr-009) | **AO ID migration (corr-008 supersedes corr-007).** 74 PG/SG IDs → 74 AO IDs (`PG-D-XX.X-001` → `AG-D-XX.X-001`; `SG-D-XX.X-001` → `AG-D-XX.X-002`). §1 docstring updated. 6 critical IDs in §3/§4 inline notes carry `formerly_known_as` aliases. §5 tension anchors updated. §8 cross-references to Doc 04 BG-03/BG-04 carry AO aliases. §9 validation rewritten for AO counts. Appendix A header note + DEPRECATED alias table (74 rows) added; the 74 detail cards preserved verbatim. Phase 2 lints (`lint_10_pso_rules`, `lint_11_rules_catalog`) updated to accept legacy PG/SG/CR/BPR IDs as DEPRECATED warnings during the transition window. Tech-free invariant preserved. |
| 5.0 | 2026-08-10 | Sprint 9 Executor (corr-015) | **Canonical AO IDs in §2/§3/§4 tables (corr-015).** §2 HL (35 rows) and §3 GDPR-driven (35 rows, 7 N/A) now carry an `AO ID` column with `AG-D-XX.X-001` (slot 001, regulation-agnostic HL or GDPR-driven); §4 CRA-driven (35 rows, 1 N/A) carries `AG-D-XX.X-002` (slot 002, CRA-driven). Total: 35 + 28 + 34 = 97 AO entries in the main tables (69 distinct IDs in §2/§3/§4; 74 total in document including Appendix A.NOT_ADDRESSED subs D-02.4 / D-06.4). Appendix A.A.0 alias table expanded with `Regulation` and `Sub-domain` columns (74 rows × 5 columns, self-contained lookup). §1 + §8 + §9 rewritten for v5.0 AO ID counts (note: section numbers shifted in v6.0 with §7 now NIST Controls Mapping). Doc 04 §4 BG-01..BG-05 cells updated to reference §2/§3/§4 by AO ID. Frontmatter: `version: 5.0`, `id_format: AG-D-XX.X-NNN`, `ao_canonical_ids_count: 35`. `validate_aegis_ids.py --quiet` PASS; Phase 1/2/3 lint gates PASS. |
| 6.0 | 2026-08-13 | Sprint 10 Executor (corr-016) | **NIST Controls Layer pilot (D-01.1).** New §7 NIST Controls Mapping added before Appendix A. CONTROLS/ restructured by framework→function (NIST_CSF/<function>/, NIST_PF/<function>-P/, NIST_AI_RMF/<function>/) + by_subdomain/. §7..§10 renumbered to §8..§11. D-01 detail cards (8) extracted from Appendix A to `_deprecated/07c_Appendix_A_D01_OLD.md`; Appendix A now retains D-02..D-10 (66 cards, LEGACY). Frontmatter: `version: 6.0`, `tech_free_sections` adds §7, `appendix_a_status: PARTIAL_LEGACY`, `appendix_a_cards_count: 66`, `appendix_a_migrated_to_deprecated: 8`. Pilot scope: 10 controls (5 CSF + 4 PF + 1 AI RMF) for D-01.1 only. |
| 7.0 | 2026-08-14 | Executor (§3 NIST Controls expansion) | **§7 full coverage expansion.** 35 ACTIVE sub-domains now mapped to NIST CSF 2.0 + NIST PF 1.0 (+ NIST AI RMF where applicable). §7 grew from 1 pilot subsection (D-01.1, 10 controls) to 35 subsections (~300 CSF + ~200 PF controls total). 34 new `by_subdomain/<D-XX.X>.json` files created (D-01.2 through D-10.3, excluding D-02.4/D-06.4/D-08.3 NOT_ADDRESSED). Frontmatter: `version: 7.0`, `nist_controls_full_coverage: true`, `active_subdomains_mapped: 35`. |
