> **Sprint 1 Reconciliation Note (2026-08-06)**
> Rich Mode copy of legacy `01_PHASE1_CONTEXT/07b_Proportionality_Profile.md` (v1.0, ACTIVE). Sprint 1 changes:
> - **I-10:** Status remains `ACTIVE` (the legacy doc is signed-off as ACTIVE; Sprint 1 reconciliation is content-neutral for this document — all 37 sub-domain rows, decision-table mappings, and GATE-P readiness checks are preserved verbatim).
> - **I-05/I-06 (FR/NFR IDs):** Doc references `FR-01/04` (Critical Analysis §7.1) and `IO-04` (Firebase Auth inheritance). These are **legacy v1.0 forms**. The canonical v2.0 form is `FR-{DOM}-{NN}` (e.g., `FR-IAM-01`) and `NFR-{CAT}-{NN}`. The mapping is documented in `00_METHODOLOGY/REFERENCE/fr_nfr_numbering.md`. <!-- LEGACY: numeric FR-01, IO-04 form, see canonical mapping in fr_nfr_numbering.md. -->
> - **I-07 (rule counts):** Doc references "Q4 Critical patching 24h, high 7d" indirectly via Critical Analysis. The canonical v2.0 rule count is **46 rules (30 CR + 16 BPR)**. <!-- LEGACY: 38 was v1.0; canonical v2.0 is 46. -->
> - **I-13 (02_Regulatory_Mapping_Master.md deprecation):** Not referenced. N/A.
> - Body content unchanged from legacy. Sprint 2 will validate the 5-attribute coverage per row against the corpus `considerations` field.

> **Sprint 3 Corpus Cross-Check Note (2026-08-06)**
> Cross-checked 10 representative rows in §4 against the corpus at `00_METHODOLOGY/PREPROCESSING_by_domain/domains/`. Findings:
> - **Track B `verification_method` ≠ Corpus `requirements.*.yaml.verification_method`.** 07b's column carries the **Track B tier-specific attribute value** per `proportionality_model.md §6` (MINIMAL=INSPECT, LIGHTWEIGHT=DEMONSTRATE+INSPECT, DEFERRED=`—`). The corpus's `verification_method` is a **regulatory method** (uniformly `TEST` at high-level aggregation) that defines how the fit_criterion is verified. These are complementary, not identical, dimensions.
> - **Track B `example_controls` ↔ Corpus `considerations`**: 07b's `example_controls` column (e.g., "AWS S3 / DynamoDB SSE-KMS enabled (AES-256 default)") aligns with the corpus's `considerations` block (e.g., for D-01.1: "CRA's `state of the art` (product-level, harmonised-standards floor — the strictest)… a single encryption deployment with a joint risk-assessment artefact discharges all four obligations"). Both converge on AES-256 as the control primitive.
> - **All 10 spot-checked rows PASS.** See §11 for the full cross-check table.

# Proportionality Profile — TinyTask SaaS

## 1. DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This document is the **case instance** of the Track B Proportionality Model for TinyTask Lda. It binds every ACTIVE sub-domain in this case to a concrete tier and to the five operational attributes (`satisfaction_pattern`, `evidence_depth`, `verification_method`, `ownership`, `example_controls`) defined in `00_METHODOLOGY/REFERENCE/proportionality_model.md` §6.

This document **does not alter Regulatory Baseline**. The `fit_criterion` and the HSO for each sub-domain remain frozen per `00_METHODOLOGY/REGULATORY_BASELINE.md` §6. Track B only annotates *implementation*, *evidence depth*, and *ownership* per sub-domain — never the regulatory floor.

**Invariant (quoted from proportionality_model.md §1):** "The regulatory `fit_criterion` and the security objective (HSO) **are never modified by Track B**. [...] Track B only varies three axes: `satisfaction_pattern`, `evidence_depth`, `ownership`." This profile respects that invariant in full: it produces no requirement relaxation, only a bounded operationalisation per tier.

**Gate criteria:** This file is consumed by `eval_proportionality.py` (GATE-P per `dependency_graph.yaml`). It must be complete and internally consistent before Phase 1 exit.

## 2. COMPANY PROFILE METADATA

Inputs are read from `04_Company_Context_Assessment.md` §2 (size) and §5 (intake summary, complexity tier, FTE).

| Attribute            | Value                              | Source                              |

| Stack                | AWS (eu-west-1), Firebase Auth, Stripe | Doc 04 §7 / Doc 05 §5.2          |

Because `S = MICRO` and `security_FTE = 0.85 ≤ 1.0`, proportionality_model.md §5.2 applies: any SHOULD/COULD sub-domain drops one tier, and the `DEFERRED` marker becomes available.

## 3. TIER ASSIGNMENT SUMMARY

The deterministic decision table (proportionality_model.md §5.1, §5.2, §5.3) yields the following distribution for the 37 ACTIVE sub-domains (D-08.3 INACTIVE — out of scope per Doc 07 §3).

| Tier        | Count | Rationale (decision-table entry)                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LIGHTWEIGHT | 31    | MICRO + BUILD_REQUIRED + MUST (proportionality_model.md §5.1 row MICRO col BUILD_REQUIRED) → LIGHTWEIGHT                                                           |
| MINIMAL     | 5     | MICRO + INHERITABLE + MUST (§5.1 row MICRO col INHERITABLE) → MINIMAL                                                                                              |
| DEFERRED    | 1     | MICRO + BUILD_REQUIRED + SHOULD + FTE ≤ 1.0 (§5.2 drop-one-tier rule; SHOULD = LIGHTWEIGHT - 1 = MINIMAL, then deferred because MICRO + FTE ≤ 1.0) → DEFERRED   |
| **Total**   | **37**|                                                                                                                                                                    |

No tier floor is breached: every MUST is at MINIMAL or above (proportionality_model.md §5.3). No INHERITABLE row was forced to LIGHTWEIGHT by priority (none exist for SHOULD/COULD INHERITABLE rows in this case).

**Statement:** Profile is **consistent** with the Phase 3 critical analysis. No recommendation from `Critical_Analysis_Micro_Enterprise.md` is contradicted; every deferred or right-sized item in the critical analysis maps to either a MINIMAL/INHERIT row (e.g. phishing → D-08.1) or a DEFERRED row (e.g. threat-led pentest → D-02.4), and every heavyweight recommendation maps to a LIGHTWEIGHT/BUY_MANAGED row using AWS-native tooling.

## 6. GATE-P READINESS

This file is consumed by `01_IMPLEMENTATION_TOOLS/evals/eval_proportionality.py` configured as **GATE-P** per `00_METHODOLOGY/REFERENCE/dependency_graph.yaml`. The eval verifies the following on this file:

| Check | Description                                                                                                            | Status |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| (a)   | A tier is assigned for **every** ACTIVE sub-domain (37 rows in §4; D-08.3 INACTIVE and omitted by design).             | PASS   |
| (b)   | The five attributes (`satisfaction_pattern`, `evidence_depth`, `verification_method`, `ownership`, `example_controls`) are non-empty for every assigned row. The DEFERRED row carries `"—"` for the five attributes, which `eval_proportionality.py` recognises as the explicit DEFERRED marker (proportionality_model.md §6 does not bound attributes for DEFERRED). | PASS   |
| (c)   | Tier consistent with §5 decision table for `(S=MICRO, I, P)`. Verified row-by-row against the table in §3.            | PASS   |
| (d)   | Critical-overload rule (eval Rule 11) satisfied: at MICRO + FTE 0.85, the only SHOULD row (D-02.4) is DEFERRED, leaving 0 SHOULD/COULD rows at LIGHTWEIGHT or above. No overload.                                                   | PASS   |

GATE-P exit code propagates to Phase 1 exit per `dependency_graph.yaml`. This document is therefore ready for the orchestrator to run the eval against it.

---

## 7. INPUT TO PHASE 2

Every obligation in Doc 08 (`08_Obligation_Derivation.md`), every rule in Doc 11 (`11_Rules_Catalog.md`), every architectural node in Doc 14 (`14_Architectural_Nodes.md`), and every allocation in Doc 15 (`15_Allocation.md`) **inherits** `tier`, `evidence_depth`, `verification_method`, `ownership`, and `control_selection` (`example_controls`) from the corresponding row of §4 above. The cross-SO sub-SO pair annotations in the Notes column are propagated to Doc 11's sub-SO realisation rules (notably D-01.1 SAME pair, D-05.3/D-05.4 GDPR Art. 20-17 pair, and the CRA-only rows in D-07.x). Doc 08 obligation rationales must cite the row id from §4 when they invoke a tier-justified relaxation.

## 8. VERSION HISTORY

| Version | Date       | Author         | Changes       |
|---------|------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1.0     | 2026-07-13 | Compliance Lead | Initial release — case instance of Track B proportionality model for TinyTask SaaS. |
| 1.4     | 2026-08-06 | Sprint 5 Executor | Deep enrichment — §4 table extended from 10 to 13 cols (added Risk if not met, Maturity cur→tgt, Implementation Priority). NO Effort/Cost/Timeline fields added per Sprint 5 scope. Frontmatter updated: status → DEEP_ENRICHED, sprint → 5. Risk values derived from priority + tier + sub-domain risk profile (HIGH for D-01.x encryption, D-04.3/4.4 incident, D-05.3 erasure, D-09.2/9.4 risk/records, D-10.2/10.3 audit/compliance testing).

## 11. Sprint 3 Corpus Cross-Check

> Spot-check of 10 representative rows from §4 against the corpus at `00_METHODOLOGY/PREPROCESSING_by_domain/domains/D-XX.Y/`.
>
> **Important:** Doc 07b's `verification_method` column carries the **Track B tier-specific attribute value** (per `proportionality_model.md §6`), NOT the corpus's `requirements.*.yaml.verification_method`. The corpus's `verification_method` is a **regulatory method** (uniformly `TEST` at high-level aggregation) that defines how the fit_criterion is verified; the Track B value defines how the company's chosen control is verified within the chosen tier. The two are complementary dimensions.
>
> The cross-check verifies: (a) 07b's `verification_method` matches the Track B tier definition, AND (b) 07b's `example_controls` aligns with the corpus `considerations` block (which describes the regulatory convergence pattern).

### 11.1 Cross-Check Table

| Sub-Domain | Tier (07b) | Doc 07b verification_method | Track B tier definition (proportionality_model.md §6) | Match (Track B)? | Corpus verification_method | Doc 07b example_controls | Corpus considerations (excerpt) | Match (considerations)? |

**Result:** 10/10 rows PASS on both Track B tier-definition match and corpus-considerations alignment. 0 mismatches.

### 11.2 Cross-Check Methodology

For each spot-checked row, the cross-check performed these checks:

1. **07b tier × Track B verification_method match**: Verify that 07b's `verification_method` value matches the Track B tier definition per `proportionality_model.md §6`:
   - MINIMAL → `INSPECT`
   - LIGHTWEIGHT → `DEMONSTRATE` (config) + `INSPECT` (review)
   - STANDARD → `TEST` + `DEMONSTRATE`
   - RIGOROUS → `TEST` + `ANALYZE` + external audit
   - DEFERRED → `—` (no verification_method bounded)

2. **Corpus verification_method extraction**: Read `00_METHODOLOGY/PREPROCESSING_by_domain/domains/<Domain>/D-XX.Y/D-XX.Y.json` → `requirements.high_level.yaml.verification_method` (regulatory method).

3. **Corpus considerations extraction**: Read `requirements.high_level.yaml.considerations` (multi-paragraph convergence narrative) and look for control-primitive keywords matching 07b's `example_controls` (e.g., "AES-256", "AWS", "Firebase", "SBOM", "DPIA", "CloudTrail").

### 11.3 Key Findings

1. **Track B verification_method is consistent**: All 10 rows pass the tier-definition match. The verification_method column in §4 correctly follows the proportionality_model.md §6 tier table.

2. **Corpus verification_method is uniformly `TEST`**: All 10 high-level `verification_method` values in the corpus JSON sidecars return `TEST`. This is the corpus's multi-reg aggregation point; per-reg decomposition lives in `requirements.sub_requirements[]` (which can return `INSPECTION`, `DEMONSTRATION`, etc.). For TinyTask's maturity assessment purpose, the high-level `TEST` is sufficient.

3. **Example controls align with corpus considerations**: All 10 example_controls in 07b align with the corpus's `considerations` block. The corpus describes the multi-reg convergence pattern; 07b instantiates one concrete control per sub-domain (AWS S3 SSE-KMS for D-01.1, Firebase Auth baseline for D-03.1, etc.).

4. **No conflicts detected**: No row in 07b §4 contradicts the corpus's regulatory baseline. The 5-attribute profile (satisfaction_pattern, evidence_depth, verification_method, ownership, example_controls) is consistent with both `proportionality_model.md §6` and the corpus's `requirements.high_level.yaml.{fit_criterion, verification_method, considerations}`.

5. **D-02.4 DEFERRED is correctly marked**: The single DEFERRED row (D-02.4 Threat-Led Pentest) carries `—` for the five attributes, which `eval_proportionality.py` recognises as the explicit DEFERRED marker per `proportionality_model.md §6`. The corpus's own narrative ("no OJ mandate for default-class CRA manufacturer") aligns with the Track B DEFERRED decision.

## §12 Track B Decision Table (Sprint 4 addition)

> Sprint 4 adds the explicit deterministic decision trail per `proportionality_model.md §5.1` + `§5.2` + `§5.3` — the (S, I, P) → Tier mapping that drives §4. S fixed at MICRO (Doc 04 §2). I from Doc 05 §5 `scope_overlap`. P from Doc 07 §3 priority column.

| Sub-Domain | S | I | P | Tier | Rationale |
|-----------|---|---|---|------|-----------|

| D-10.3 | MICRO | BUILD_REQUIRED | MUST | LIGHTWEIGHT | §5.1 row MICRO col BUILD_REQUIRED = LIGHTWEIGHT |

**Distribution:** 31 LIGHTWEIGHT + 5 MINIMAL + 1 DEFERRED = 37 (matches §3 summary).

**Floor-rule check (§5.3):** Every MUST ≥ MINIMAL. ✅ (no MUST below MINIMAL; D-02.4 is SHOULD, not MUST — DEFERRED marker only applies to SHOULD/COULD per §5.2/§5.3).

## §13 Tensions Cross-Reference (Sprint 4 addition)

> Sprint 4 elevates the 4 strategic tensions from Phase 2 `09_Strategic_Tensions_Report.md` (legacy) into the Phase 1 Rich Mode. Full resolution table with max-SLA routing is in `07c_Adjusted_Goals.md §5`. This section provides a one-line cross-reference for each tension and how it interacts with the proportionality table in §4.

| Tension ID | Sub-Domain(s) in §4 | Type | Severity | Resolution (max-SLA routing) | Cross-ref |
|------------|---------------------|------|----------|------------------------------|-----------|
| T-001 | D-04.3 (LIGHTWEIGHT) | timing | HIGH | 24h internal clock satisfies GDPR 72h + CRA 24h | Doc 07c §5, Doc 07b §4 row D-04.3 ("max-SLA 24h internal; unified incident workflow") |
| T-002 | D-06.1 (MINIMAL), D-06.3 (LIGHTWEIGHT) | scope | MEDIUM | Unified vendor management (DPA + SBOM) | Doc 07c §5, Doc 07b §4 rows D-06.1 + D-06.3 |
| T-003 | D-09.1 (LIGHTWEIGHT), D-09.4 (LIGHTWEIGHT) | requirement | MEDIUM | Integrated documentation repo (DPIA + CRA-RA) | Doc 07c §5, Doc 07b §4 rows D-09.1 + D-09.4 |
| T-004 | D-08.2 (LIGHTWEIGHT) | intensity | LOW | Competency matrix (GDPR + CRA) | Doc 07c §5, Doc 07b §4 row D-08.2 |

**Invariant preserved:** Tensions are resolved through operational procedures + design decisions; the regulatory `fit_criterion` and the tier assignment are NOT modified (per `proportionality_model.md §1`).

---

## §14 Corpus Provenance (Sprint 4 addition)

> Sprint 4 adds the explicit corpus provenance for (I, P) inputs and the Tier output. Each row in §4 (and the decision trail in §12) is traceable to a specific corpus field.

| Input | Source | Field | Used for |
|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| **S** (Scale) | Doc 04 §2 / §5.1 | `employees` + `revenue_eur` → MICRO | §5.1 row MICRO (decision table lookup) |
| **I** (Inheritability) | Doc 05 §5 (`scope_overlap`) + corpus `requirements.high_level.yaml.scope_overlap` (corpus cross-check) | `N` → INHERITABLE; `Y` → BUILD_REQUIRED | §5.1 column (decision table lookup) |
| **P** (Priority) | Doc 07 §3 (`priority` column) + corpus `requirements.high_level.yaml.normative_intensity` (sanity check) | `MUST` / `SHOULD` / `COULD` | §5.1 vs §5.2 row selection |
| **Tier** | derived: `tier = f(S, I, P)` per `proportionality_model.md §5.1` + §5.2 + §5.3 | — | §5.1 cell value |
| **HSO** (frozen) | corpus `D-XX.Y/D-XX.Y.json` → `security_objectives.high_level.objective` | — | Doc 07c §1 (preserved verbatim per §1 invariant) |
| **Sub-SOs** (frozen) | corpus `D-XX.Y/D-XX.Y.json` → `security_objectives.sub_objectives[]` | — | Doc 07c §1 |

**Per-sub-domain corpus manifest path pattern:**

```
00_METHODOLOGY/PREPROCESSING_by_domain/domains/D-XX_<Domain>/D-XX.Y/
├── D-XX.Y.manifest.json   (L2 manifest — taxonomy metadata)
├── D-XX.Y.json            (L3 sidecar — HSO + sub-SOs + considerations)
├── D-XX.Y.md              (corpus pipeline merged view)
└── articles/              (L4 — verbatim regulatory articles, 623 files total)
```

**Examples (from §4 cross-checked rows):**

- D-01.1: `00_METHODOLOGY/PREPROCESSING_by_domain/domains/D-01_Data-Protection/D-01.1/` → L3 JSON sidecar `D-01.1.json` → `security_objectives.high_level.objective` (frozen HSO) + `security_objectives.sub_objectives[0..1]` (GDPR + CRA Sub-SOs).
- D-04.3: `00_METHODOLOGY/PREPROCESSING_by_domain/domains/D-04_Incident-Response/D-04.3/` → corpus's "A unified multi-recipient notification pipeline is operated generating per-regulation submissions from a single underlying event record, with per-recipient clock-start discipline" (considerations block) — corroborates the max-SLA 24h resolution in T-001.
