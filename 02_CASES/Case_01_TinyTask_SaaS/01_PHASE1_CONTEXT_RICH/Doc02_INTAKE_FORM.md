> **Fase de Especificação 1 Reconciliation Note (2026-08-06)**
> Rich Mode copy of legacy `02_CASES/Case_01_TinyTask_SaaS/00_COMMON/01_Company_Context.md` (v2.0). File renamed from `01_Company_Context.md` → `01_INTAKE_FORM.md` per Rich Mode naming convention (this doc is the case's Intake Form, not a generic company context doc). Fase de Especificação 1 changes:
> - **I-10 (status DRAFT → RECONCILED):** Fase de Especificação 1 milestone.
> - **I-13 (02_Regulatory_Mapping_Master.md deprecation):** Banner added in frontmatter. `02_Regulatory_Mapping_Master.md` was previously cited as a downstream output; it is deprecated and superseded by `00_Taxonomy_Reference.md` + corpus.
> - Body content unchanged from legacy. Fase de Especificação 2 will add L2 manifest cross-references per answered question.

**Purpose:** Determine which regulations apply through branching logic.

### 3.1 GDPR Applicability

```
START: Does the company process personal data of EU residents?
├── YES ──────────────────┐
│                        │
│  Is the processing      │
│  purely local/household│
│  activity?             │
│  ├── YES → GDPR: NOT  │
│  │     APPLICABLE     │
│  └── NO ──────────────→ GDPR: APPLICABLE
│                        │
└── NO → GDPR: NOT APPLICABLE
